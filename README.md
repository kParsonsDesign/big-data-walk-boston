# "Walk Boston" Big Data Exercise
> Assignment from week 5 of MIT Full Stack Professional Certificate.

## Description

### Initial Goals:
Download a 22,000+ line data table, search for and display the following 2 objectives:

1. The goal of this exercise is to pick out the top 5 earners in Boston (total salary + overtime) and list them out in the web page as shown below:
| Name       | Total Earned |
| ------     | ------------ |
| First Name | $000,000     |
2. Next, pick out the number of people working in the city of Boston who earn over $100,000 and display it on the web page as shown below: 

Number of people working in Boston earning over $100,000 is xxxx.

### Refactoring:
- Added Bootstrap styling
- Added the full table to the live page using jQuery and the jQuery Data Tables Plugin


## To Run
This project can be viewed on a browser at [kparsonsdesign.github.io/bigData/](https://kparsonsdesign.github.io/bigData/)


## Roadmap
I may come back to this project to improve the onpage styling. Currently there is too much information on the page.
